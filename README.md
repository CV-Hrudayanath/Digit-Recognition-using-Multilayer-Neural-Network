# Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network with Backpropagation Learning
Implementation of Handwritten digit recognizer using Neural Network.


# Dataset
Dataset used for this is MNIST dataset. Can be obtained from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ . Dataset has 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples along with labels. The digits have been size normalized and centered in a fixed-size image and forming image of 28x28 pixels.

# Neural Network 
Considered all the 28x28 forming 784 pixels as the number of input nodes/units for the neural network. The output layer has 10 nodes/units each node representing digits from 1-9 and last node as 0.

We Feedforward the input to the network and then backpropagation learning is done.
